## 2.1 Daam

It's been a year since March 2023, and I haven't managed to write anything new in this section of the series of articles about Saam, Daam, Dand, Bhedh, Vedh. So, I decided that I ought to complete this section about "The Status Quo", one way or another. 

The concept of Daam (दाम) alludes to "the cost" of an offer, that each party would need to incur upon accepting and ratifying a deal through negotiations; but I don't have anything new to offer, to Canadian authority figures and government officials. The deal available to them, was laid out in [*"Appendix VI of The File."*](https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities/blob/main/navigating-this-gitrepo.md#20-navigating-this-documentation) Whatever type of "a carrot or a stick" that I had, was explained in *The File.* But then, I ran out of carrots. The window of opportunity for availing any type of a new offer, has unfortunately, closed. 

Here is an example of why I don't have anything new to offer, to pretentious cheats. 

There are certain Canadian officials in Kitchener-Waterloo Region of Ontario, who like to claim that Canada invented the concept of ["The Blue Bin"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box_recycling_system) for recycling waste materials collected from households and offices. 

However, almost nothing that has ever been placed into a Blue Bin, in Canada, has ever been recycled, by Canada. Since decades, almost all of it has ended up in landfills or incinerators within Canada, or has been shipped overseas to countries like China, Laos, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, or Pakistan for being disposed. Of course, China stopped accepting nonsense and garbage from countries like Canada in 2016, for which Canada retaliated by extraditing Huawei's CFO to the US during US-China trade wars. It's been eight years since that incident, and Canadian diplomats have yet to comprehend that the repercussions and consequences for threatening or messing with South and East Asians, can be rather severe. 

It can be observed that among Canadian voters, a culture of lying to each other and being pretentious, each-and-every day for decades, is the only thing keeping top Canadian officials in power. Such a wide-spread culture of self-deception, of shared delusion, and of pretense, is also keeping the Canadian public from realizing that all of them are promoting an utterly wasteful existence via practices like fracking, while blissfully barreling towards a completely bleak future, in an ever increasingly polluted Earth.  

Are Canadians ever going to be able to snap out of it? If [Louis C. K.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_C.K.) was a Canadian and if he cared to, then maybe, he could have helped Canadians by trying to generate more awareness among his viewers about such issues, through his artful performances. But otherwise, it seems unlikely that a majority of Canadians will ever realize that pretending to doing their part for the ecology, by tossing waste materials into dysfunctional recycling programs will only continue to harm Canada's denizens and pollute the rest of the world. By the way, those government subsidized, waste management and recycling programs have continued to increasingly degrade soil, air, and water profiles of North America, especially in the Arctic regions where endangered species are being pushed towards extinction by callous human activities. 

Similarly, healthcare professionals throughout Canada have continued to peddle highly narcotic drugs like Zyprexa through forced prescriptions (see, *Appendix I and II of The File*), to young and elderly patients in need of treatment for grogginess from issues like sleep apnea, even though the drug is not at all a viable pharmaceutical intervention for lethargy or sleep apnea. The falsehoods, and deceptive standards and practices baked into Canadian industries and societies, is primarily for enriching a few North American corporations, through illegitimate profits obtained by heavily exploiting generations of uninformed and innocent groups of unassuming peoples.
