canada claims to have invented the concept of the blue bin for recycling waste materials. 

however, almost nothing that has ever been placed into a blue bin in canada, has ever been recycled by canada. practically all of it has ended up in landfills or incinerators within canada, or has been shipped overseas to countries like china, laos, vietnam, bangladesh, india, or pakistan. 

a culture of lying is the only culture that keeps people from blowing their brains out, from realizing and acknowledging that they are just lousy human beings, living an utterly wasteful existence towards a completely bleak future, in an ever increasingly polluted earth.
