canada claims to have invented the concept of the blue bin for recycling waste materials. 

however, almost nothing that has ever been placed into a blue bin in canada, has ever been recycled by canada. almost all of it has ended up in landfills or incinerators within canada, or has been shipped overseas to countries like china, laos, vietnam, bangladesh, india, or pakistan. of course, china stopped accepting nonsense and garbage from countries like canada in 2016, for which canada retaliated by extraditing huawei's cfo to usa during us-china trade wars.

it can be observed that among canadian voters, a culture of lying to each other and being pretentious is the only thing keeping top canadian officials in power, and from realizing that they all are promoting an utterly wasteful existence, blissfully barreling towards a completely bleak future, in an ever increasingly polluted earth.
