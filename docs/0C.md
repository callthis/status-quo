# Sympathy for Nazis, Question Mark

Around December-2022, YouTube suddenly recommended to me, [a video about the history of Lutheranism](https://youtu.be/1qeRj_qfNM0) in the 17th and 18th Century (Common Era). The video had a message baked into it, about justifying "a culture of vendetta" against Jews which had swept the nations of Germanic peoples, during the run up to the 19th Century CE. 

It was somewhat interesting and even thought provoking. Its posited an argument about how Jewish landlords promoted a cruel form of fiefdom in Europe, by exploiting the lack of literacy in Latin and Hebrew among commoners of disparate Germanic states, during the feudal era. Those Jewish landlords usually cited The Torah and The Talmud, available in Latin or Hebrew versions to very few rich surveyors, as a source of "unassailable legal text" for a landlord's rightful and legitimate use of violent force upon servants, and for collecting tithe as well as other large sums of equity from bonded laborers as taxes. After centuries of being put to cruel humiliation and suffering, under the yolk of Jewish rulers and landlords who were a minority group of people in Europe with the ability to cunningly oppress a majority of the erstwhile German Empire, 'a miraculous reform' occurred via [Martin Luther's translation of The Vulgate Gospels and other Christian texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Bible) into common vocabulary, for it could be readily taught and followed by Germanic speech communities. 

According to that dramatized video documentary, once the common lay person within Germanic lands could read "The Law of The Land", in an accessible language, they were able to fend off the cunningly contrived social order labeled as Rabbinic teachings about *Halakha* that had been illegitimately used for justifying the cruelty thrust upon Germans. The newer, or rather, The Lutheran Bible in common German language, supposedly, provided a more authentic and just cause for not only chastising bad Jewish landlords, but also for a revolutionary uprising to overthrow the oppressors of Germanic peoples. 

Now, all of that could be dismissed as hearsay. But it was an interesting take on why Antisemitic feelings swept through Europe among ordinary German people, at a time when the popularly known narrative was that: Jewish communities had continuously been the victimized and oppressed masses, ever since the age of the Pharaohs throughout the Egyptian and Mesopotamian empires, and eventually, Jews were violently forced into becoming a repressed minority throughout the territories and history of the Roman, Fatimid, Byzantine, Russian, and Ottoman empires. 

So, did Lutheranism truly give rise to the emancipation of German peoples who rightfully revolted against their Jewish oppressors, through a socialist uprising that led to the "federalization" of Germany? German people entered into "early modernity" as a federated single nation because of Lutheranism is the conclusion of [that video at its 42 min, 17 sec mark.](https://youtu.be/1qeRj_qfNM0?t=2417) Now, even if such a conclusion were somehow truthful, even to the minutest extent possible, the popular narratives known to people of current day and age, are about the ways in which Nazis went extremely overboard with their supremacist ideologies in federating Germany, only to produce gruesome forms of violence, that plunged the entire world into abject darkness. That darkness has continued to take its hold on 'victors' of previous World Wars whereby, 'the victorious supreme leaders of the new world order' from Britain and America, after nuking Japan, have continuously tried to do throughout the Earth, what the old-school Nazis didn't manage to fully orchestrate.  

It is possible that there is some truth to that documentary about Lutheranism, in providing  a historical narrative with some type of socio-political causality explaining "a just German uprising" against Jewish oppressors, wherein the Germans *copied* Jewish military as well as feudalistic tactics and strategies used against themselves, to create the federalized Nazi state. It is entirely possible that subsequent to the two World Wars, the Jewish state of Israel has *copied and enhanced* the Nazi tactics and strategies suffered by Jewish peoples at the hands of German oppressors, only to create an apartheid state against Palestine, wherein the Israeli armed forces continue to commit genocide by killing approximately three or four male Palestinians per week. Those many killings of unarmed, non-combatant civilian youths per week by Israeli armed forces, goes unnoticed by almost all media outlets.  

The above sets of paragraphs only indicate that each successive group, or generation of people, in and around the Mediterranean region, became what they despised, by adopting the only things they ever came to know, that is, gruesome violence and oppression. It appears that a cascade of events where the oppressed become the oppressors, has continued for centuries.

So, in view of all possible rationales and documentaries, is there a way to have sympathy for Nazis, or to empathize with them? 

Well, at least not for me. Nazis were just plain old bigots who didn't just murder and rape Jews. They went after anything and everything that would give them immediate financial power, and maximum political control, by using the most ruthless means available. 

The job of the supremacist is to merely pose as a supreme sovereign, regardless of the means of achieving supremacy. For a supremacist, a victory is a victory, no matter how foul and dirty the methods deployed for attaining that victory turn out to be. Supporters of supremacists are those people, who have always propagated the idea that "all is fair in war." They have also continued to promote and propagate the notion that, "there can be no such thing as a war crime that can ever be committed by a sovereign power, under any conceivable circumstances." 

> However, genocidal activities committed by military personnel or by any other state-sponsored agents with immunity offered to them via pretexts of sovereignty, or national security, does not make those genocidal activities any less of a crime against humanity and human ecology. 

This is why I cannot sympathize or empathize with Nazis, and with other supremacists or Zionists.

Any mature human should be able to observe that we are dumber than plants, and not at all superior to any living beings, even compared to zoo-spores or phytoplankton, because, unlike ordinary plants and even micro-organisms, we have yet to figure out how to live in harmony with nature by not causing pollution. So, by no means are any of us supreme in any good and worthwhile sense of the word, "supreme." 

Furthermore, all commercial and industrial-scale human activities cause pollution. So any activity done over-zealously to achieve any form of supremacy, or monopoly, is bound to generate maximum pollution that harms and existentially threatens, all living beings. Humans might instead be categorized as, "Supreme polluters, and exterminators of Earth's living species." 

Therefore, the only sensible thing to do is to be a component of Earth in nature — as a harmless and humble, humane being.  

As such, how harmless and humble am I? 

I'd like to illustrate my stupefyingly acerbic and abrasive attitude towards supremacists, with the following figure. Some things in nature and of nature need to be sufficiently edgy by design, in order to edge out the crookedness of dastardly fiends, no matter how suave and smooth those dodgy goons appear to be in their external outlook.

    <b>The obvious, long-standing injustice.</b>
</p>

And how humane, compassionate, or merciful am I?

Genuinely, I do not have a killer spirit. I don't feel like killing any person to get what I want. That is why I happen to have a streak of zero kill rate, and zero murder rate. It's just that I wouldn't kill you even if you begged me to. You see, I would merely end up giving you some spiel about the need to embody, and preserve ideals like hope and faith, and to brave through adversities without simply quitting or dying. This is also because death isn't final in any sense of the word, "final." 

You don't have to trust me on that statement about death not being final, you'll eventually find out for yourself. By the way, going through life and death, even infinitely many times, does not make a being immortal. That being only remains sufficiently mortal, to experience mortality, even if it be to the tune of infinitely many iterations of experiencing life and death.  

I also highly prize my zero kill rate. I've spent a very long time in this realm without killing people, and I'm not going to give up my record of zero kills for simple vengeance regardless of how justified my rights to retaliation have already come into being. I'm not a medieval Quaker or a Jesuit, or a Lombard, to prioritize "Retributional Law" over "Restorative and Restituional Law." That is why I had become particularly upset and grieved, upon seeing my misappropriated research and development (R&D) work on artificial intelligence and drones, being used in targeted mass killings of civilians as well as in careless killings of non-enemy soldiers. It still upsets me because those wretched violations are still ongoing.[^1] 

Given that I happen to be well-acquainted with the genocidal people who stole my work and engineering designs, and given that I know how they won't tap out, or admit to their culpability with any form of remorse or guilt, I have simply decided to abide by the **"status quo."** The status quo here is that Canada and its allies, can do whatever they want to do, and I will simply continue to do whatever I feel like doing.

All of the time spent by Canadian entities and their allies in deflecting, denying, or simply staying silent about their culpability in wretched crimes that defile the lives of innocent civilians, gives me the opportunity to keep writing. 

What could writing a bunch of articles and posting them online in a version controlled repository possibly achieve, right?   

The restitution owed to me and to other survivors of coordinated crimes committed by state-sponsored entities from North America and the UK, is a debt that I will invariably collect on, in due time, and in a manner of my choosing. 

So what options, or leverage do I currently have? How much force can I apply, <b><i>if the need arises?</i></b>
