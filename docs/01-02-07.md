## 1.2.7 Zero-day Faults

>Zero-day faults, lead to the possibility of zero-day hacks. 

In the nineteen-eighties and nineties, the phrase "zero-day fault", meant that a foundational assumption, or a stipulation concerning the design and delivery of a system, was so hopelessly wrong, that the entire system had to be redesigned and rebuilt after taking it off-line, in order to rectify that error. In essence, a system with a zero-day fault, turns out to be fundamentally flawed from day one of its adoption and use in the hands of consumers, because of irreparable issues stemming from research, design, and deployment cycles preceding the very first day of its usage. 

Consequently, people who become adept at discovering, exploiting, and taking advantage of zero-day faults within telecommunications and supply chain systems, came to be labeled as hackers, by pop-culture authors; and those who took undue advantages of a system via unethical hacking, used to be labeled as crackers, by old-school *phreaks*. 

These days, the word ["hacking"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/yogv0z/life_hack/), has a wide variety of tropes, connotations, and meanings associated with it. 

However, the older generation's definition of zero-day faults, was modified and toned down drastically since the mid-2000s, when buzzwords like "cloud computing" and "machine learning" started being sold to enterprise clients of managed information technologies. How safe is your private and critical data, "in the cloud"? Only as safe as your behavioral hygiene with telecommunications devices that are connected to the public internet! 

The human-in-the-loop, is eventually the weakest, as well as the most conveniently overlooked link, in any socio-technical system.  

So, these days, the newer definition used among major cyber-security companies, to appease customers while covering the "company's downside", only alludes to the idea that, when an R&D based issue in a system sold to clients is detected and properly recognized, for which the company that sold the system is to be held responsible and liable, and only to the extent of having to provide a work-around or a patch for "mitigating the problem", then, the faulty software or hardware system being used by the company's known clients, can be addressed as "a zero-day error" or "a zero-day fault", if the satisfactory solution to the identified problem cannot be supplied within the terms stipulated within the "Service Level Agreement" contract. 

The fact that zero-day faults are practically irreparable, exist as an irreplaceable building block of the system due to engineering and managerial decisions made prior to the system's sale and usage, and can lead to a whole host of damages to stakeholders, were removed from all conversations and communications, throughout the cyber-security industry and markets. The focus was instead shifted to the strategy of replacing the entire system along with its faulty, fundamental component, with a newer 'compliant' version of the whole system, by completely reworking the system's architecture from scratch, to address the privately discovered problems and issues. Most importantly, such expensive and time consuming overhauls were to be done without letting the client feel the "psychological consequences" of learning about those types of changes, from any publicly syndicated records. The mantra followed by tech-giants, consulting firms, as well as start-ups simply became, "Forget the physical and socio-economic negative consequences suffered by gullible end-users, as long as 'the management and leadership' of the responsible company can be made to look innocent in the public's eye." And when that is not possible, do a bit of 'public relations damage control', to the extent that is 'reasonably justified and feasible', without creating a 'fuss.' 

Many other problematic issues that used to be labeled as a zero-day faults, were eventually found to be reparable or replaceable, using newer technologies and innovations in the long-run, after suffering large-scale damages for decades; so, even computer operating system providers, and other big-tech and banking companies became more cautious about labeling a discovered organizational or a technological issue, as a zero-day fault, by creating an "income tax-deductible fund" to absorb those existing and foreseeable damages. 

Examples of fundamental issues that can be labeled as zero-day faults include: 

- The global issue of the ways in which "narrow-gauge" railway tracks, are incompatible with "broad-gauge" and other types of railway lines, that are too difficult to replace or substitute, within the context of globalized logistics and transportation costs. 

    - Long-term losses due to inefficiencies in trying to bridge incompatible components of railway lines have continued to increase, and faltering railway companies in North America have only been able to stay operational due to communism-style, tax-payer backed subsidies. Eventually, the loss to tax-payers in North America will turn out to become so large that railway stations, locomotive vehicles, tracks, ticketing services, and manufacturing as well as maintenance infrastructure for passenger trains will have to be scrapped completely. The advantage of finally doing so will be to optimize railway lines for freight trains. However, quite naturally, a whole lot of blood-letting is going to continue within North American heavy industries that are tied to locomotives. In hindsight, African and Central Asian countries still have the opportunity to learn from such colossal screw ups of the North American locomotive industry and its associated bureaucracies, to commission and build their rail infrastructure.  

- The way in which a pair of crypto-currencies known as [Terra and Luna collapsed.](https://www.consumernotice.org/legal/crypto-bankruptcies/) Those digital currencies were tied to a fraudulent scheme developed by Terra block-chain's proprietors, which was being covered up by using slick marketing and sales tactics used by fiat-currency borrowers using that blockchain. Similarly, due to shady business practices of founders and executives, who have managed to repeatedly con the public with their "fake it till you make it attitude", include: [FTX, Genesis Global Capital, and Gemini Trust.](https://www.consumernotice.org/legal/crypto-bankruptcies/) 

    - Socio-economic losses suffered by public investors associated with Terra crypto-currency, was to the tune of $300 billion US dollars, which was wiped out in hours from global currency-exchange markets when the fundamental flaws within the company promoting that crypto-currency was exposed to the public. Losses to public investors from other crypto-coins and their associated monetary exchanges collapsing, merely within the year 2022-2023, has been more than $2 trillion USD. 

    - The worse problem here is of the tiny likelihood of speculative investors ever learning from such massive debacles, to become more careful and diligent in doing their research on vendors as well as markets that offer trades in crypto-currencies and non-fungible-tokens, before making the decision to invest in those types of digitally manufactured merchandise. Unfortunately for the world at large, too many gamblers who pretend to be investors in stock market shares, commodities, and other financial products, think that they will be the ones who will come out on the top, after pump-and-dump schemes orchestrated by them. 

In a more abstract yet tangible sense, from a systems perspective, a fault in a computer software such as a "multi-media player" that poses a security risk to its users, isn't as bad as a fault in the computer's hardware that could allow a remote user to take over the entire "workstation", or a "mainframe", during its boot sequence. Also, the process of quantifying the potential security threat, or exposure to various risks faced by end-users of a set of compromised systems, has more to do with the type and number of users who actively use the "overall system." 

So, when it comes to categorizing the "type", users who are part of aerospace, defense, institutional financing, public utility, and public services sectors of an economy, are the type of people who handle a large volume of sensitive and critical data, at a highly frequent rate. The attributes of high frequency, large volume, critical and privileged data, due to the type of work that professional users engage in, distinguishes those workers from other customers of a system, who might otherwise have lesser access rights and user privileges to, say, a network of computers in an office building. 

Over the past two decades, as computer science and associated technologies have advanced exponentially across the globe, the likes of the US government and other international agencies, eventually came up with requirements for mapping all nodes of every telecommunication network, within three "degrees-of-separation" of denizens in their federal jurisdictions, for "security reasons." Here is what three degrees-of-separation implies for you: The contact list in your phone would constitute one degree-of-separation, your contacts' contacts would be two, and *their* contacts would be labeled as individuals within three degrees-of-separation from you, if you were to become a "person of interest", based on any kind of a retrospective or a preemptive reasoning applied by "an authorized security agency." 

As an example, and on a smaller scale, the task of tracking the online and on-ground activities of "interesting or consequential entities", is similar to counting the number of birds that exist within the metropolitan area of a given city, at any given time period; where in, usually, by the time one manages to count the birds (or mobile communications devices) within a geo-fence, some would have flown in, and others would have flown out, leaving a probabilistic estimate of the entities in need of being tracked. Now, simply expand that task to the entire scale of the planet and to: three degrees-of-freedom of every tagged 'bird', ('vehicle' or 'device'), that happened to enter into the 'sovereign territory' of any of the nations, which these days includes, the EU, the US, the UK, the UAE, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Japan, India, and Israel. 

For such gargantuan challenges in fulfilling the needs of large enterprise clients known as "international security agencies", a framework with a set of technical vocabulary for describing "human-machine interfaces" was devised in the late-1900s, by people who used to call themselves [cyberneticians or cyberneticists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberneticist). These days they are simply called mathematicians, or physicists, analysts, or "[cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cybernetics) engineers." The work produced by deceased cyberneticians and cyberneticists, eventually came to be popularized by various other systems engineers and researchers in the form of, "ecological interface design"; so as to also accommodate interactions among non-human entities that may posses artificial intelligence (AI), generalized animal intelligence, swarm intelligence, and generalized human or humanoid intelligence. 

### 1.2.7.1 Ontological Methods in Systems Engineering 

[Ecological interface design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_interface_design) is considerably different than "design thinking", as the design and construction of ecological interfaces between nodes of an abstracted network of systems in an environment, starts with axioms of physics and mathematics that describe the given "complex socio-technical" ecosystem in analytical terms. Those sets of predicates, or descriptive statements of an ecology obtained via work domain analysis, are human as well as machine-readable. Whereas, statements discovered through trial-and-error based user-experience research in design thinking, are from a psychological, socio-political, economic, business and anthropological perspective, which are only human readable. The method of knowledge discovery used in ecological interface design, eventually incorporates all possible data that can be unambiguously addressed via other methods of describing the "reality" of a situation, including geo-spatial and temporal aspects of an observable chain-of-events, from all humanly possible perspectives. 

The main use of ecological interface design has been in building "expert systems", and "enterprise resource management software tools", that are capable of managing trillions of nodes of a [mesh-network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking). 

The special set of methods and techniques from ecological interface design used for "knowledge discovery, and classification of a network's topology", eventually produce an ["upper ontology"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology) of physical things and socio-linguistic constructs pertaining to the given network of "autonomous and semi-autonomous agents." Also see, [Web Ontology Languages (OWL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language#Acronym)   

In particular, the use of ecological interface design principles and methodologies, used within the lab that I was employed in during the years 2008 to 2010, were for managing fleets of manned and unmanned military vehicles, plus, their operating and support personnel as well as associated resources. The word "resources", included strategic and tactical forms of physical, psychological, sociological, legal, and financial inputs for several sets of "missions", as well as documents and manuals pertaining to different models of equipment used by identifiable military units, along with "on-ground and online" modes of communication used among military personnel, staff, contractors, and defense R&D groups. 

>If you had to build a set of "real-time", enterprise resource management tools, for its associated telecommunications networks used by all wings of "the US military", for being deployed in a "Battle Theater" with active "Battle Zones", how would you go about researching and designing it, especially for rapid prototyping and testing of technologies usable within "provably earnest" missions? 

That type of a resource management tool had to answer difficult questions like, "What is the optimal way to produce individualized definitions for the scope of a situation, tailored for each autonomous agent exposed to an ongoing planetary-scale cybernetic war, which includes military positions and objectives in Earth's sub-surface as well as outer space regions?" In other words, "What type of knowledge, and inference, is to be made available to each active entity, within which format and modality, at which particular intervals of time and geographic locations, for achieving a predefined doctrinal goal, through a set of 'earnest and legally valid' objectives?" 

### 1.2.7.2 Doctrines are Unquestionable, Question Mark

What do you suppose could even be the most basic goal or a mission, for a state-sponsored apparatus operated by a federal government? 

For example, the goal or requirement of: "rapid production and continuous deployment of military grade technologies", has been a constant among supply chain members in UK, Western Europe, and North America. This is because the US military and its allies are perpetually engaged in at least one multi-national war, at multiple battle fronts, and that too, merely for the sake of increased defense budgeting and expenditure year-over-year, as a driving force for America's nationalistic economic growth towards — inter-planetary supremacy. The aforementioned constant goal, has been, and is still being taken for granted, as the basic tenet adopted by the US federal government, in each-and-every conceivable geo-political scenario it comes into contact with, across the entire world. 

So, what might happen if something like "climate change", which many Canadian and US government officials are too quick to dismiss or deny, were to cause a 'dead-lock' to arise within various parts of the industrial supply chains needed for furthering defense R&D projects of Northern Atlantic Alliances? 

Especially, what if that type of a dead-lock was imminent in brittle industry sectors linked to commercial airplane operators in Northern Americas and Western Europe, because [wholesale insurance companies, and international underwriters](http://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/FIO-June-2023-Insurance-Supervision-and-Regulation-of-Climate-Related-Risks.pdf), have continued to keep increasing their premiums for home and business owners, based on flea ridden assumptions, and obsolete actuarial science models? Worse, imagine if they were to simply refuse to insure various geographic locations in North America due to increasing risks of flooding, wild fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, hail storms, sink holes, earth quakes, volcano eruptions, smog, wind sheer, and sleet? That would be a violation of a fundamental tenet that the US has taken for granted, wouldn't it? 

Undoubtedly, *force majeure* in the form of climate change, isn't going to impact the work undertaken by every vendor or supplier, within the industrial and military supply network of every country, in the same consequential manner. There might be a number of suppliers who would have to back-down from supplying certain semi-conductor manufacturing equipment and components, to countries like Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa, due to emerging threats posed by pandemics and climate change, to NATO's geo-political and socio-economic ambitions. This is one of the main, foundational issues currently being faced by Euro Zone economies that have already halted, or are halting exports to major markets of the world, because their trade deals with BRICS countries have suddenly become coupled to the effects of militaristic legislation adopted by the US and its allies, in contradiction to "norms and conventions of international free-trade agreements." 

Likewise, China might have decided to restrict the supply of raw materials like lithium, gallium, aluminum, copper, nickle, cadmium, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, palladium and platinum group metals, rare-earth elements, machined components, as well as monetary credit, through its corporations and also through those of its allies, to industrial sectors like automotive manufacturing and real-estate construction, in countries like Australia and Canada. China's rationale for doing so might be stated simply as, "The Chinese Communist Party's need for protecting its national interests in the dynamically changing socio-economic, geo-political, and physical environment of ongoing international affairs." 

Can you imagine the levels of persistent unemployment and social distress, that destruction of equity and natural heritage will continue to generate, as a consequence of grid-locked supply chains worsening with wars and increasing climate disruptions throughout the world? 

However, those kinds of fiscal and monetary issues related to geo-politics and macro-economics, aren't as fundamental as getting the physics and mathematics wrong, in being able to properly answer the [stoichiometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry) question:

- What amount of materials in kilograms are produced through the aerobic combustion of, one kilogram of a hydrocarbon like methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)? 

- You may use [these hints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry#Stoichiometric_air-to-fuel_ratios_of_common_fuels) about aerobic combustion of common fossil fuels for estimating an answer which should include not only the gaseous products, but the liquid and solid ones as well, especially for fossil fuels like coal and biomass. One must also consider the amount of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, that are dumped into the Earth's ecosystem from burning commercially supplied fossil fuels. 

The above question cannot be answered correctly, by most legislators, as well as military and business leaders from influential countries of our planet, even with all the hints and help provided to them. If they could, they would have realized by now, that: when approximately 80 billion metric tons (i.e. 80,000,000,000,000 kg) of fossil fuels are burnt each year, across the Earth, then its hazardous and toxic combustion products continue to be wafted around globally, which don't magically disappear into outer space. Moreover, those combustion products as well as toxic by-products from fossil fuel excavation and refinement processes, don't turn into non-polluting substances within days or years. In fact, non-biodegradable pollutants from plastics and petrochemical industries will continue to harm the Earth's biosphere, for thousands of years. 

For instance, the following is an example of how a military unit's lack of understanding and preparation, concerning ecological sustainability, impacts its efficiency in performing its duties, as well as its conspicuousness in being easily tracked and targeted: 

>The problem of active-duty military personnel not knowing and understanding how to pre-sort, and properly compact their trash and waste materials, is so bad, that when they dump all of their refuse into one corner of their sea-fairing vessel (and land based living quarters), they create a bottle-neck for the movement of people and materials through their ship (and their barracks). The unnecessary burden of sorting mixed refuse is then thrust upon a staff at the "bottom of the pecking order", who is typically made to feel sufficiently 'comfortable', with their 'noble' duty of manually separating different categories of materials, at their trash sorting station. The materials that aren't recyclable and easy to handle, often end up being dumped into the surrounding environment, creating a conspicuous trail of the military unit's activities and operations, which become conveniently recognizable in ground based as well as aerial and satellite based observations. 

A process for properly collecting and disposing discarded non-living materials, that needs to be fully automated, without staff and personnel carelessly throwing their waste into the natural habitat around them, has remained in the blind-spot of military commanders and specialists. The fact that the 'breadcrumbs' and 'droppings' of a creature, happen to be the most tell-tale signs for tracking the creature, is somehow lost within the acumen of Army Rangers, and even in that of the Navy and the Marines. 

Is the Air Force of a country any better? Somewhat better and more conscientious, only because there is practically no room in an aircraft or a spacecraft to carry waste. Burning aviation or rocket fuel to transport tons of garbage and human waste on an aerial platform, would be a worse act of generating pollution, and of destroying money, compared to producing other types of biologically hazardous materials on the Earth's surface from human activities. 

It is plainly evident that the ecology of a creature forces it to adopt patterns of hygiene and living standards, in order to merely exist without needless suffering. Predatory people who intend to molest and plunder nations, have figured out that defiling the habitats and microcosms of ethnic communities in the name of 'progress and development', is the foremost task in depriving targeted individuals of their humanity. Subsequently, those repressed individuals and communities are turned into fodder for the industrial-military corporations operated by colonialists, and supremacists. Thus, the task of eradicating the culture of a targeted ethnicity is readily achieved by racist Supreme Leaders, by first defiling the natural environment of targeted populations, and then by dehumanizing, vilifying, and demonizing them, in order to sadistically rob them of their equities, only to finally enslave, or murder indigenous populations. 

By desecrating the homes and habitats of targeted groups, the survivors among those groups are deprived of basic human rights, and healthy living conditions. Then, for garnering "popular support" of their racist followers, Supreme Leaders portray the *deprived* person or community, as a *depraved* person or ethnicity, so as to have indoctrinated followers gladly do the dirty work of illegitimately detaining and abusing cunningly targeted individuals. The so-called depraved person is then labeled as "fair-game", so that racist colonialists, cultists, and supremacists can more freely and 'justly', exercise their malice and sadism upon targeted individuals. Worst of all, and much more cunningly, the state of being poor, distressed, or completely destitute, is portrayed by Neo-liberal racists as "the moral failings of a person's character, due to a spiritual or a biological 'disease'." 

This is why the most filthy and exploitative corporations on this planet, happen to ship their mixed refuse, e-waste, junk, and scrap metals, at the magnitude of billions of metric tons per year, from North American and European shores, only to dump all of it into cities of South and South-East Asia. They also happen to do so using cargo vessels that burn the most toxic sludge from crude oil refining industry known as marine diesel oil and heavy fuel oil, because a majority of sea freight is only transported using that sludge. Also, they do all of it in the name of providing 'gainful employment' in waste management industry, to the earnestly hardworking communities of 'Third World' countries. Similarly, almost all polluting agricultural and heavy industries as well as manufacturing operations reliant on fossil fuels are deliberately installed in regions where predatory capitalists can manipulate local politicians, to handicap or completely scuttle, important environmental protection policies. 

So, when China stopped processing the waste materials from North America and Europe in 2016, it was a signal to the world that China's self-esteem had suddenly grown from being the world's sweatshop with it rag-pickers, to the new global trend setters in ecological sustainability. The white-supremacists of the world did not like that, and they decided to start trade-wars to put the Chinese "into their place", beneath the foot of the uni-polar world's ruling class of standard-bearers in Washington D.C., Dublin, London, Paris, Brussels, Rotterdam, Berlin, Milan, Jerusalem, Doha, Dubai, Soul, and Tokyo. 

Of course, the Politburo in Shanghai was never going to tolerate being treated by "Western Alliances" as sub-humans, in any conceivable universe, because they naturally have their own version of the Chinese manifest destiny. 

Indeed, leaders of 'First World' countries have continued to treat regions of the Earth like Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Laos, as the planet's dumping grounds for industrial-waste, since the early 16<sup>th</sup> Century. And, the self-esteem as well as the sense of pride and self-image of people living in those poorer countries, from being tarnished and treated as bottom-feeders who are only worthy of rutting in a decaying landfill, hasn't yet grown to the level that they can simply say, "No!", to the physical, political, and socio-economic garbage being dumped onto them by Western nations. 

Leaders of those subdued, 'Emerging Economies' in the current era, have simply continued to cajole and console themselves with the idea that they are at least, not being abused as badly as the way countries like Guam, American Samoa, Guatemala, Argentina, Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, Mali, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Ukraine are being trashed by policies and behaviors of "The 'Mighty' G7 Countries." 

>*The worst zero-day fault, is perhaps the false sense of safety and security one can harbor, from having cunningly usurped socio-economic liberties, and political power.* 

I suppose the problem of who is to currently take up the responsibility for [averting pollution related catastrophes and conflicts on a global scale](https://youtu.be/pEt6-jA2UE4), can be solved by increased military spending for more blood-soaked wars, when the same type of a problem is not even being solved correctly at the scale of a single aircraft carrier or a submarine, right? 

Well, global-scale wars in the form of 'cold-wars', 'trade-wars', and cyber-warfare, leading to ballistic World Wars with heavy armaments are guaranteed, within the next ten years. Each tomorrow for ordinary people living on this Earth, is bound to be more violent, repressive, and much more polluted, than each today, for at least the next six years, until industrial electrification via near-zero-emission technologies can come into commercial existence, and can be afforded by *the most populated* regions of the world. Of course by then, too many parts of the world would have already been turned into war-torn badlands. 

Therefore, if even highly disciplined, well-funded, and 'cultured' military officers, diplomats, and bureaucrats in most countries cannot figure out the significance of ecological sustainability in relation to the survival of human civilizations, what can be expected from the goals and behaviors adopted by poorer, uneducated masses of the world? 

So, as a tribute to the international 'rules based' playing fields and dumping grounds, for the better or for the worse, let me publicly disclose the basic features of a military AI system, designed for ever increasingly automated warfare. 

By the way, would any of you like to work on detecting paths traced by submarines wading through polluted waters containing micro plastics, using hyper-spectral images of oceans taken from space satellites?
