    "A shrub in the desert is a tree. 
    And for a dust-mite in the desert, 
    The shrub might as well be an entire forest."

'Tokenizing' special characters in a set of strings,
can be challenging. However, numerals like: 765239 
can be handled more conveniently. On the other hand,
a defined value such as 2.220446049250313e-16 might not 
get parsed correctly. And hopefully you obtained the given
text with suitable line-endings in the form of \n 
or an empty space such as "", instead of a
\r\n or a sudden 0x1A in the middle of the text. 

Additionally, make sure that white spaces didn't encode
some kind of a special meaning.

Figuring out what counts as a typesetting error, spelling 
mistake, typo, or a grammatical mistake versus 
an encoded message, is an important task, that can be taken up

in a later stage of analysis.

Having said that, a coder's or a code breaker's ability to notice
trends or repeating cellular structures known as "patterns"
is key to parsing, and thereafter interpreting the given text,
or a sample of signals.
