<b>Table 1:</b> Basics of resolving or sustaining conflicts

The above set of words in Hindi language, collectively form an idiomatic expression that alludes to the possible options available to people, during the aftermath of any kind of an event, primarily towards conflict resolution. When the aftermath of an event is tragic due to a set of factors that have already transpired, and have produced damages along with some type of a conflict between opposing parties, the way forward can be achieved through a combination of vedh-saam-daam-dand-bhedh.  

## 1.1 Bhedh

Let us start with the not so obvious, and seemingly, the last option that is ever adopted by South Asians, who tend to prefer all other options compared to the concept of instigating "Bhedh" among their opposition, or among the camps of their enemies. 

In Southern Asia, Bhedh is usually associated with the idea of creating discord and division, among opponents and their surrounding social habitats. Supposedly, if all other options fail, the only sly, yet effective strategy available to you, would be to cause chaos and confusion, by sowing seeds of doubt, hatred, disgust, and a sense of betrayal, among the allies of people who stand mortally opposed to you as enemies.  

I have no idea how the above notion came to become seated within the pop-culture of Southern Asia. Perhaps it was from the TV Series called "Mahabharath" from the nineteen-nineties. Or perhaps, because the word is often translated in English as "discrimination", its allusion has come to evoke a strategy of causing hostilities to grow between two groups, in order to bring those groups under control, or to simply create mischief. I would like to instead tell you about the word's meaning which has nothing to do with underhandedly creating discriminatory animosity, among groups of people who are opposed to you, in order to weaken or destroy them. The word — Bhedh, has more to do with a decision maker's ability, "to conduct precise and accurate, measurements and comparisons" (सही तुलना कर पाना), in order to ascribe suitable value judgments, to discernible things.

A proper and worthwhile judgment regarding a situation can be produced by a decision maker, only when the factors linked to the situation, that have generated causal impacts on concerned persons, can be scoped, measured, analyzed, and critiqued in a conscientious manner. 

This immediately brings into question, the level of competence a decision maker has, or can have, in discerning the "reality" that is impinging upon them, during the process of conducting an investigation, for producing a valid, impartial, correct, and fair judgment. 

In chores involving legal decision making, the act of choosing which foundational principles and frameworks are to be applied, is the foremost task of a legal decision maker. "Conflict of laws", or the matter of choosing private laws that can be made applicable across jurisdictions where they wouldn't normally be applicable, becomes even more pertinent and significant, in international-scale conflicts. Therefore, one must be able to discern the facts and postulates of a series of events, with respect to a chosen datum, in order to subsequently promote a particular measure of conciliation, compensation, and/or penalties which can resolve the problems that have arisen, as a result of those chain-of-events. 

What is truth? What is reality? What counts as a fact? What is a datum? How is the scope of a situation to be defined? Which principles are scientifically relevant? How is relevance or linkage to be established? How can a set of events be reified during discussions and arguments? Which set of principles are to be prioritized during the course of adjudicating procedures? Which form of an escalation or a de-escalation can materialize with mere passage of time? What counts as fairness? What can be deemed as satisfactory, by whom and for whom? Which cultural and inherited norms can be used as precedence? Who is the "ultimate" decision maker or adjudicator, in resolving a dispute or a conflict? By which authority or powers can a judgment be enforced, and within which geo-political realm of influence? Is there an absolute datum with respect to which, other things can be measured or gauged? Is every observable thing an emergent phenomenon of relativistic interactions among pre-existing things that lack any spiritual essence? What is to be done when an impasse is reached due to irreconcilable factors pervading a present scenario? These are the types of questions that have challenged human beings over the ages, and have continued to be debatable among diverse groups of individuals. 

However, it is also true that certain fundamental scientific principles prevalent in the universe, underpin all possible ways of gathering as well as processing information, in order to be able to make an educated decision and a valid judgment, about any conceivable contextual matter, within every possible situation. So, fundamental principles restrict how a person may be able to discern things, and how a person can discern things restricts their ability to even comprehend sets of fundamental principles. 

Is the above statement a Catch-22? It certainly looks like one; but the more important thing to note here is that such a cardinal aspect of "reality", *within the entirety of the universe across all possible realms, in every measurable span of time,* only highlights the ways in which: any being or a collection of systems, that happens to be mortal, or even has the slightest hint of mortality within themselves, possibly cannot be "The Supreme Ruler", or "The Ultimate Judge", or "The Peace", or "The Law."

## 1.2 Vedh

There might as well be certain kinds of "first principles", pertaining to law and order that provide guidance on how to identify and resolve disputes, especially in grievous matters concerning the theft and destruction of people's lives and livelihoods. 

If there ever was a "truth" to be observed in this Universe, it would at least need to start with the idea that ["observability"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability) and ["controlablity"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability) are physical phenomena that allow interactions among corporeal beings. 

Before we get into a deeper discuss on the topic of foundational precepts (Vedh), let me direct your attention to the question: 

>"While talking about the concept of a mind, have you ever managed to analyze a mind that wasn't in a body of any sort? And particularly, if a mind that you were able to interact with and analyze was in a body, wasn't that body within an environment? So where then does the mind reside? Can there ever be a body without an environment? Can there ever be a body without a mind? 
>
>Would you be conceited enough to assume that just because an entity did not present itself in a manner to satisfy your criteria of a healthy and a sound mind, that it didn't have one, as opposed to you having simply never possessed the appropriate depth of understanding on how beings can merely exist in nature, without needing your permissions and categorizations about their state of existence? More importantly, was it you that caused your existence to manifest within this universe, by choosing to come into existence prior to having any kind of a physical form? Did you truly chose to be born of your own volition, prior to even having any type of volition that was strictly yours, and only yours? How will you ever manage to prove or disprove any type of an answer to such questions to other people in a 'scientific' way?"

For millennia, there have been a large variety of ways in which people have tried to come up with answers for the above types of questions. And even if, you were able to come up with ideas or answers right now, that would satisfy you, how would those answers alter the state of knowledge about such topics for any other person on Earth, at any other conceivable point in time? 

The staggering variety in how these types of questions can be answered or even approached, naturally gives rise to "differences of opinions", and "cultural differences in worldviews" among any set of people who may come into contact with each other, and then remain in contact through some quality of interactions, for any span of time. 

What might be the maximum level of severity of physical outcomes, from any possible conflicts that may be resultant from 'struggles' between groups of people? How might those outcomes impact the lives of innocent bystanders who can't even be directly linked to conflicting interactions among any given parties that are opposed to each other? 

Over the ages, so-called wisdom and ways for directing one's life has been passed on from generation to generation, about how to survive or "succeed" in this universe. Given that this universe is guaranteed to present difficulties and challenges to living beings, which set of "inimitable and unerring precepts have you imbibed?" And so what if those sets of precepts are "the ultimate test of good vs bad, or legal vs illegal?" Their existence doesn't say anything about your or my skill in being able to practice and embody them. Several cannons of knowledge and information do exist, each which might not even be acknowledged as the greatest of all "scriptures and divinely bestowed commandments", and are still adhered to by their proponents as the purest and most pious form of dictum to all of human kind. An example of such a collection of ideas on a parchment, would be any industrialized country's political constitution, especially the American one, that is often touted as the greatest boon to humanity by its followers. 

What's more, those types of codices derived from partisan activities of racist and sexist "forefather", have remained notably inconsistent and ambiguous in how they are to be interpreted by modern people, and in how they are to be implemented by future oriented societies. Worse, those enshrined documents with their demonstrably glaring flaws and problematic loopholes, are taken as flawless, foolproof, and future-proof norms fashioned by divinely ordained Supreme Leaders. Such basic issues have remained a part of day-to-day lives of people from all over the globe, for most frameworks of legal discourse, from any part of the world, present differing and opposing views on what ought to be done on the very same set of discernible facts when a challenge presents itself in the context of those facts. This has been especially true when a legal decision is to made on who is going to have final responsibility and say on how a given situation ought to be dealt with. This is why, quite often, people resort to the 'economic practice' of using aphorisms and maxims, that tend to take the place as a substitute to the need for having unambiguously recorded legal statutes, even when those aphorisms are derived from mythological stories and religiosity of a bygone era. 

One such aphorism that I heard recently was: "It is better to be an armed warrior in a garden, than to be an unarmed gardener in a battlefield." 

Sure, the above-mentioned maxim sounds sufficiently esoteric and wise, as if it ought to be adhered to by anybody who even has half the wit to be able to say it out-loud. One may then even conceive that as soon as any group of people were to start following such a saying, they would almost immediately be able to claim to have become fit, and ready, for any type of a battle, whenever and wherever required, compared to all those who failed to appreciate and follow such a truism. However, usually, wars are fought for capturing and exploiting gardeners (especially young female ones), as well as for capturing and plundering their 'gardens' and equities, by those who feel that "might is right." 

So, is there any room for non-violence in this universe? What can innocent people do once their equity, including the equity contained within their body and in their reproductive rights, are stolen by predatory brutalists, or by insidiously cunning [mentalists](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mentalism). 

One could start with the idea that the might of treachery, guile, cruelty, and brutality isn't right nor supreme, especially in the face of साहस (courage), प्रामाणिकता (authenticity from honesty and integrity), करुणा (compassion), and दया (mercy).
