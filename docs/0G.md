## 0G. Statement of Intent and Purpose

Has there ever been a shortage of people who have humbly and politely spoken to you or to any ministers of parliament, about putting an end to Canada's ongoing state-sponsored violations and international crimes? Has no other person ever gently notified you that Canada still owes reparations with compounding interests, to survivors and victims, of those numerous crimes and offenses? 

Am I genuinely the very first person to have brought such topics to your knowledge and attention? So, what difference would it have ever made, if I were to do so, politely and gently through formal or informal channels, like the rest of the tens of thousands of survivors, activists, and advocates have done before me, during the past six decades? 

The most egregious violations committed against me by operatives and agencies in Ontario, Canada, similar to the ones they have been committing against indigenous peoples and other ethnic minorities out of xenophobia and racism, were that of: causing the death of my child; causing loss of consortium with my spouse and business partner; destroying my business and means of earning a living; defiling my home and desecrating my place of worship via surreptitious home invasions; thrusting me into severe poverty and undue distress; assassinating my character by painting me as a "violent psychopathic terrorist mercenary"; illegitimately detaining me and then torturing me using biochemical methods to cause reproductive harms; causing long-term debilitation; attempting to entrap me under duress and under the influence of forcibly administered overdose of narcotic drugs in captivity; forcibly repressing me during Ramadan of May-2020 with the explicitly verbalized intent to see what I would do from being violently deprived of peace and security, in a degrading manner, only for stripping me of my humanity and of the ability to practice religious supplications on Eid, specifically because of my Muslim heritage and Islamic beliefs; disrupting my ability to present material evidence of genocides committed by Canadian, British, and American defense contractors and R&D groups in Afghanistan and Iraq; destroying a copy of that material evidence through surreptitious means via the willful and deliberate disruptive actions taken by the Law Society of Ontario; and then chasing me out of Canada under the pains of death and threats of murderous violence against my family. None of those insidious violations involving breach of trust committed via the use of systematic tools and coordinated efforts, among judiciary and public service units along with their contractors in Canada, were "a minor infraction" or "a tiny mistake!"     

While your hired analysts attempt to categorize production of such sets of articles as "narcissistic delusions" or as an "idle rant", without having had access to a file called ***"scenarios.md,"*** they ought to ask themselves if there could possibly ever be a person on this Earth who could be narcissistic or delusional, compared to Donald Trump or Adolf Hitler? Additionally, *scenarios.md"* might better inform you, about how artificial intelligence (AI) based vectors succeed in producing an effect, by being highly automated, and by removing the human operator from all operational steps. An AI designer and an artist such as myself, isn't anthropocentric, so never mind the idea of being self or ego-centric. Various topics and automated vectors illustrated in the file called *scenarios.md,* are not dependent on any one particular human-in-the-loop, at any point in time within the cybernetic domain. They are certainly not contingent on me or my state of existence. 

To then say that my apparent online demeanor or behaviors, including my seemingly direct or harsh tone, in sending such articles to the social media addresses of 'elite and busy' organizations and individuals, is somehow evidence of psychosis or delusional thinking, would be wrong, misguided, and politically motivated against persons like me. That is because, a person who was at one time, more than a decade ago in the US, hired and tasked by those types of 'elite' organizations to build and refine a full-fledged analytical framework for systems design and development, particularly with the given objective to create "Blue Sky Projects" that can circumvent US and international laws, wouldn't bother to send repetitive idle rants to various groups and organizations, without the measured and considered decision to expose the depths and secrets of that framework, and of those wrongful employers. 

Those wrongful employers, such as the University of Iowa (UIowa), the US Office of Naval Research (US-ONR), the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (US-DARPA), and by extension, the US Department of Defense (US-DOD), were never truly honest with or loyal to, persons such as myself, as indicative from their exploitative hiring and employment practices that were always geared towards stealing and infringing upon [intellectual properties and moral rights belonging to international students and workers.](https://github.com/true-hindsight/long-overdue-justice?tab=readme-ov-file#21-main-reasons-for-seeking-relief-via-international-interventions)    

Plus, I have continued to maintain my restraint and patience, in acknowledging the dignity and importance of your offices. However, if I were required to compromise for the sake of compromising, and in the interest of "letting things go", my capacity to maintain patience and restraint, and to act in the way of mercy, would be the foremost things I would compromise on, and let go of. For things such as patience, restraint, and mercy are wasted upon habitual offenders and absconding debtors, especially upon those who continue to commit genocidal high crimes and misdemeanors, against vulnerable people, with abject contempt and disregard for all of the notifications and warnings those offenders have been given, politely or otherwise. 

Therefore, my intentions haven't been to merely make you red in the face, with a few quaint or silly memes on a social-media channel, my only intent and purpose, is to obtain proper justice, against the injuries, harms, and damages that my family and I were made to suffer at the hands of colluding agents and racist agencies operating in North America, particularly in Canada. 

>For now, you can rest assured and be happy that I am not a specter, because even though there is such a thing called "Casper The Friendly Ghost", there is simply no such thing as a friendly specter.
