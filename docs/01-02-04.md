## 1.2.4 Empathy, Sympathy, and Solidarity

A sense of empathy is only feasible when episodic memory is evoked, from learning about things that another person has genuinely lived through, or is currently going through in their life. Furthermore, functions of the cerebellum, and the medulla are necessary to experience empathy because those regions of the brain are more strongly related to memories created from embodied movements within a physical region of space and time. Hence, the concept of a time-bound episode, includes various details about the bodily sensations from a place with its sequence of events. This means that a person who can empathize with another person's lived experiences, has necessarily been through those experiences, in the most tangible and similar way possible. This is why there isn't a way for a male person to ever empathize with the situation of experiencing childbirth, via the gestation period of a pregnancy. A biologically male human being, simply has no memory about ever having been pregnant to rely upon, in order to be able to empathize with a biologically female human being, who has been through physical experiences like mensuration, abortion, or childbirth. 

A person who has not been through a particular physical experience, can at best sympathize with another person upon learning about his or her situation, by drawing inferences from memories of events that are reasonably similar to the other person's situation. Feelings of sympathy tend to involve a state of comprehension and pity, about a person's lived experiences. Sympathizing with one's self can happen, but empathizing with self is not feasible, because empathy is strictly a feeling for another person through vicarious understanding of what that other person has, or is going through. 

Feelings of sympathy and empathy can also be about jubilation, and not only about experiences of challenges, and of loss, pain, or suffering. Not being able to sympathize or empathize with anyone else, makes a person oblivious to their social surroundings. However, being devoid of the capacity to sympathize and empathize with any other person, while not being dead or in a coma, is a very rare occurrence, and chances are that we may never be able to empathize with what it feels like, to be utterly oblivious. 

The above-mentioned sentences might not have been the expected approach to considering what empathy is, or isn't. What's more, those sentences haven't yet been qualified as scientifically true, with references and citations. So, let's explore the topic of memory from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience, to better understand the core emotions called sympathy, and empathy, that are supposedly necessary, for any human being to actually be humane, morally upright, and just. 

Types of [consciously retrievable memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory) include: 

1. Semantic memory of a person related to factual things, or tropes, that can have a word associated with them, in a language or an encrypted code known to the person's speech community. Examples of semantic memory can be, "Everest is a mountain while the Pacific is an ocean", or, "Speedy unicorns aren't always hungry for juicy apricots." Memory of such trivia or codes, <ins>need not</ins> be associated with any kind of a physical setting, or time period, or a place the person has physically visited. Such memories also don't include any recollections of bodily movements or physical sensations. 

1. Procedural memory is related to sequence of steps involved in doing something. For example, "To bake a good tasting cake, measure out and mix dry ingredients separately from the wet ones, and later combine the two before transferring them into the suitable dish, when following a baking recipe." 

1. Episodic memory pertains to lived experiences involving interactions with people, places, or things, at a particular point in a person's life. For example, "What happened on the day I was illegitimately arrested and detained by Waterloo Regional Police Services, and the ways in which I was violated by public service personnel during the subsequent days of that arrest, is explained in *The File,* to the best of my recollection and abilities."  

Before I continue into deeper scientific explorations about memory, and showcase how long-standing institutional malfeasance has corrupted they way neuroscience is taught throughout Westernized nations, let me briefly speak about solidarity. 

>Solidarity is the act of knowingly and willingly taking up responsibility, on behalf of persons one empathizes with.

<details><summary><h4>Dishonesty and Cheating within Brain Imaging Studies</h4></summary>

And now, let us explore the ways in which "peer reviewed" brain imaging studies from 'august institutions' have deliberately wasted **billions** of tax-payer dollars over the past two decades, by using fabricated data to promote false narratives about the basis of healthy cognition. Fabricated data included in those types of studies have continued to be manually fashioned to fit the worldviews of Anglo-Saxon religiosity and folklore, with moralistic undertones for justifying institutionalized racism and sexism. 

Supremacists have continued to usurp cultural authority, for the purposes of marginalizing, criminalizing, or pathologizing targeted people's outlook and articulations, by repackaging racism from phrenology as, "state of the art behavioral and cognitive neuroscience." One of their methods in doing so, has involved the use of manually tuned data from brain imaging studies. 

The following episode from my life being retold here, is from the year 2014. It is about particular individuals employed by certain universities in the US, UK, Germany, Italy, and India, who tried to force me to fabricate data for them, so that they could have the results form their experiments fit the already popularized narratives promoted by their publicly funded research labs. The experiments involved study of brain physiology using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ([fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging)).  

The main steps in their experiments pertaining to [cognitive neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience), [experimental psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology), [psychophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics) and [psychometric tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics) involved: having a voluntary human subject perform few verbal, visual, or haptic tasks while the subject's brain was being scanned inside an fMRI machine. Each session with a test subject could last up to an hour. And approximately 18 to 25 sessions would be conducted over a period of a few weeks using 5 or 6 different participants. All participants were cognitively intact adults, and did not have any medical conditions that would have prevented them from living a healthy lifestyle. 

The research experiments that I was employed to work on, were conducted in Italy using a 4 Tesla fMRI machine. Here are important details pertaining to those publicly funded studies, which might be more meaningful and useful to researchers and scientists involved in neuroscience. 

1. Construction of the custom built research facility along with the 4 Tesla fMRI machine had a cost of approximately €230 million Euros, and each session to run the machine costed approximately €2,600 (two thousand six hundred Euros) per hour. Then there was the cost of salaries for all of the researchers, and technicians wherein: professors had an annual salary of €65 to €80 thousand Euros, medical technicians were paid somewhere around €48 thousand Euros per year, and graduate research assistants were paid a stipend of €15 to €24 thousand Euros per year. At the time I was working at the facility near Trento, Italy, there were around four professors, two medical technicians, and a dozen research students who regularly conducted approximately 800 hours of experimentation per year. 

1. Since the 1980s, throughout the world, fMRI scans for research purposes have typically left out the cerebellum from data pertaining to the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain). This is because the size of the scanning machines have remained so small, that a person's torso can barely fit into the scanning chamber. When high resolution scans of the cranium are taken, either a portion of the cerebrum gets cut out, or that of the cerebellum as well as the medulla gets chopped from the scanned images. So, researchers in this field of empirical studies have deliberately chosen to leave out the cerebellum and the medulla, to focus on the anatomy and physiology of the cerebrum. Only for clinical purposes with lower resolution physiological scans in an fMRI, or in structural scans using MRI mode, can one see the entire brain of a person. (Image 1 is a structural scan of my brain from 2014 using the 4 Tesla fMRI machine in MRI mode.) 


    [Image 1: This is not Homer Simpson]

1. Another reason why the cerebellum and the medulla cannot be analyzed simultaneously with scans of the cerebrum, is because the cerebellum is at least four times as dense as the cerebrum, and it has much higher frequency of activity than other parts of the brain. So, fMRI scans that are calibrated to focus on the amplitude and frequency of activities in the cerebellum, tend to wash out the data from the cerebrum. As such, fMRI scanners are tuned for the level of activity in the larger volume of the brain, that is, the cerebrum, rather than the highest density area of the brain, namely, the cerebellum. Consequently:

<details><summary><b>Click here to dive even deeper into this discussion about corruption within scientific publications</b></summary>

1. Anything that you might have heard or read about: how the brain processes emotions, thoughts, and appetites, or how aspects of an individual's brain can give rise to a person's behavioral, personality, and sexuality traits; happen to be incorrectly attributed only to parts of the cerebrum, such as the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, or to the cingulate gyrus. Even the stuff you might have read about the brain in Wikipedia, or in peer reviewed journals, to this date, mostly has information that conveniently omits fMRI data about the cerebellum and the medulla. 

1. When the same set of experimental protocols used on alive human beings were tested on [a dead fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging#Criticism), statistically significant correlations between given stimuli and activities recorded by the fMRI machine were noted. What this actually indicates is that experimental protocols and the types of statistical analysis techniques used in fMRI studies have remained faulty, but researchers have continued to dupe funding agencies for continuing to do deliberately faulty experiments. The faulty results of fMRI studies have continued to be published within reputed journals of science, via cronyism, to cheat and defraud government based funding agencies. 

1. Through cronyism, a number of Western universities have maintained a monopoly on producing narratives about which part of the brain is more closely linked to a particular mental activity, and to a range of a person's physical skills and desires. Those narratives are fallacious, and only serve to boost the cultural authority of a few researchers like [Michael Gazzaniga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gazzaniga) and [Giacomo Rizzolatti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Rizzolatti), who have been given the role authority figures, as cultural heroes, within the fields of neuroscience and cognitive science; even though their research is merely an extension of phrenology. 

1. The work done by Giacomo Rizzolatti on the existence of ["mirror neurons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron) is particularly faulty and problematic, because in his 'seminal study' that 'proved' the existence of mirror neurons, he randomly chose to study approximately 250 out of trillions of neurons in a live macaque brain, using single cell recordings. His most widely publicized experiments involved forcibly training a macaque monkey on a physical task, under duress for many months, to then cut open the monkey's skull, and poke thin electrodes into the monkey's brain tissue to record electro-chemical activity of single neuron cells, while the monkey was repeatedly made to perform the trained tasks. In such animal experiments involving live, single cell recordings, the animal dies in a few days because of the irreversible cranial surgery. Upon completing the single cell recordings from randomly chosen portions of the motor cortex of a monkey's brain, Rizzolatti claimed to have arrived at 'an empirical proof' suggesting that, the same set of neurons were activated when the monkey performed physical tasks of pushing buttons or lifting objects, as well as when it watched a video of another monkey performing the same physical tasks. 

1. What were the rest of the trillions of neurons in the monkey's brain doing during Rizzolatti's experiments investigating the existence of mirror neurons? And why are such cruel experiments on animals even useful to human society? Well, all brain science textbooks have typically ignored the first question, and likewise, almost every popular neuroscience researcher has ignored the question about what the rest of the trillions of neurons were doing during Rizzolatti's animal experiments involving single cell recordings. However, the purpose of assuming the given 'proof' of the existence of mirror neurons from Rizzolatti's animal experiments to be valid and true, has to do with explaining the concept of "vicariousness" of bodily movements in human beings. Fabricated answers derived from Rizzolatti's experiments for questions such as, do animals experience some kind of sensory stimulation when viewing activities of another animals, were extrapolated to the idea that human beings also have "mirror neurons" by virtue of being animals. The same type of experiments conducted on monkeys were conducted on human beings in US, UK and Italy, except that instead of cutting open a human skull and taking single cell recordings with electrodes, the experimental readings were taken using people put inside fMRI machines. People were asked to perform tasks such as moving a finger to push a button, their brain images were taken using fMRI, then those people were shown videos of somebody else performing the same task, and a second set of fMRI images of the human subjects' brains were recorded. Upon comparing the two sets of images using statistical analysis involving "Generalized Linear Models", it was erroneously concluded that human beings also have mirror neurons. And then a magical leap was made by those researchers to suggest that human beings can vicariously feel another person's pain, when seeing someone else go through hardships, thus 'proving' mirror neurons as the 'neurological basis of empathy.' But more importantly, such publications have been popularized to showcase that Western scientific methodology and technological prowess, has come to resolve a deeply valuable and difficult to answer question, fundamental to human neurology, psychology, and even sociology. And supposedly, people who aren't in agreement with, or empathetic to Western sentiments, are pathologically defective due to a lack of properly functioning "mirror neurons." The 'rationalizations' adopted by Western thought leaders, for diminishing and pathologizing non-Euro-centric cultural views and behaviors, come from the 'groundbreaking scientific work' carried out by the likes of Giacomo Rizzolatti. 

1. Furthermore, comparative analysis between different sets of fMRI studies, are often flawed and defective because researchers keep trying to compare 1 mm cube resolution images of the brain with 2 mm cube, or 3 mm cube resolution data, only to note that the comparisons did not yield any valid, or significant correlations. Much more problematic meta-analysis studies are the ones that do find a statistically significant correlation between different sets of brain imaging data, that possibly cannot be registered to the same units of spatio-temporal measurements. 

1. The fallacious nature of fMRI studies: begins with faulty experimental protocols; continues with erroneous image registration procedures for image processing; then proceeds with much more faulty and wrongful use of [Generalized Linear Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) on millions of non-linear, stochastic and chaotic data-streams; and finally produces results with magical leaps to conclusions from miserably expensive experiments. The same type of experimental protocols, image processing pipeline, and analysis techniques using fMRI machines can be applied to heart cells and the [celiac plexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celiac_plexus), to arrive at the very same level of statistical confidence in concluding that mirror neurons exist in people's chest and inside the stomach area, apart form existing in people's heads. 

1. The fact that fMRI based studies and publications are mostly wasteful, fraudulent, and bogus, does not matter, as long as the majority of people within cliques of neuroscience researchers, happen to wittingly or unwittingly buy into the belief, that they have been doing legitimate research work in line with 'accepted' scientific methodologies, while using fMRI machines and Generalized Linear Models to explore various 'inquiries of scientific interest.' 

1. In contrast to fMRI studies, Positron Emission Tomography ([PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography)) scans of cranial tissue across human subjects, for studying the metabolism of alcohol in the body, indicate that when formaldehyde produced from the digestion of alcohol reaches the cerebellum and the medulla, it causes the person to loose a sense of time, and to suffer memory impairments along with the inability to control fine motor movements. Formaldehyde happens to be a neuro-toxin. This means that the cerebellum and the medulla are rather important in regulating human behavior, memory recall, emotions, sense of space and time, and conscious thought processes.

1. Who would even want to know about such physiological studies conducted using expensive PET and fMRI scans, when there are convenient folktales about the left-side of the brain being in charge of analytical thinking, and the right-side, in charge of creativity. Those kinds of folktales aren't truthful in a scientific sense of what actually happens within our brains, because almost all parts of the brain are active and constantly communicating with various parts of the body, at all times. Moreover, communication between parts of the brain and the rest of the body, aren't only dependent on amplitude of neuronal and [glial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia) cell activities, they are also dependent on the frequency and phase of on-off signaling among neuron and gliocyte clusters. So, any group of people who can provide 'scientific explanations' for the basis of thoughts, emotions, sexuality, and personality traits in human beings, can gain cultural authority and pre-eminence, throughout the 'meritocracy based technocratic world', and perhaps, even throughout modern history.

To explain how I was being forced to generate fabricated data for researchers who had employed me in 2014, I must first dwell into the image processing techniques involved in fMRI studies. The image processing pipeline for neuro-imaging studies goes somewhat like this: 

    1. 

When I refused to fabricate research data in support of the previously published, peer-reviewed journal articles, from the lab that had hired me, I was naturally let go from the university's research scientist position. The price of my integrity and loyalty isn't measurable in terms of fame or fortune, because it has never been for sale, and will never be allowed to get bought by any persons, especially not by conniving cheats, by any means what-so-ever. 

There are numerous foundational, ethical, methodological, and technical flaws as well as deliberate falsehoods incorporated within fMRI based research associated with brain sciences. However, as I have mentioned earlier, those flaws and errors cannot matter to institutions and researchers profiteering from their lies and prejudices, that have already become widespread within present-day scientific research work, and literature; as long as people go along with the ignoble treachery of propagating false narratives originating from Westernized universities, as being "honest, and truthful", while pretending that those flawed publications have the highest degree of quality in terms of: modernity, utility, authenticity, and legitimacy across the entire world.
